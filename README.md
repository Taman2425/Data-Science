H1B LCA dataset predicting case status. 
Purpose: Trying to predict the case status for all the H1B LCA applications using different machine learning algorithms liks
KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, LDA and GNB.

Pre-processing: Pre process the data such that there are no null values in any of the columns, convert the columns which are categorical into sparse matrix using one hot encoding.

Steps to execute the program:
unzip the data set and place it in the same directory along with the python script.
Execute the python code in Jupyter Notebook (python version 3.X)
